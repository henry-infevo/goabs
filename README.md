# Golang Abstraction

## Motivation

When design code in golang my biggest concern is about manage dependencies:

- How can I archive Dependency Inversion principle?
- How can I switch to another third-parties quickly with less impact?
- I need fluent interface which helps code-reader can easy to understand my code

Then I spent a lot of time to design code and interface that help me archive those things above and working harder to get my task done. Another painful is when I change my job I need to redesign everything :(
